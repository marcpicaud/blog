If you don't have an explicit technical leader, you'll end up with an implicit one. The funny part is when it's not be the same person for every member of the team. This will lead to a worse productivity at the best, and to confusion and conflicts otherwise.

Make sure you have one tech lead, who should be one of the most skilled and one who has the team's best interests at heart.

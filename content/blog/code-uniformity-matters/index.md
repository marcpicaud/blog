Having the same code style throughout all projects has many advantages.

It reduces the noise and the cognitive overhead during code review. Your git diffs won't be filled with re-indentations, carriage returns or single/double quotes updates.

It closes trivial debates like tabs VS spaces, 2 spaces VS 4 spaces, semicolons...

Use the same linter rules throughout all projects. Make the CI fail on linter errors.
